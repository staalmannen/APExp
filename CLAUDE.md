# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

APExp (APE with experimental patches) is an enhanced ANSI/POSIX compatibility layer for Plan9/9front. Its goal is maximal GNU/POSIX compatibility — the pragmatic opposite of Plan9's NIH philosophy — so that C programs written for UNIX can be built on Plan9 with minimal modification.

**Important:** APExp is intentionally unstable between releases. Breaking changes are expected between releases; the best option for users is to download the latest release.

## Build System

The build tool is `mk` (Plan9's native make equivalent). Mkfiles use rc shell syntax, not POSIX sh.

```sh
# Full build and install (run from repo root, on Plan9/9front)
mk install

# Note: run twice — syscalls are not always integrated into libap on the first run

# Clean build artifacts
mk clean

# Nuke everything
mk nuke
```

The install target:
1. Removes old arch-specific lib/ape files
2. Creates output directories for all 11 supported architectures
3. Runs `./mount-include` to bind APExp headers over the system headers via union mount
4. Recursively builds: `sys/src/cmd`, `sys/src/ape/9src`, `sys/src/ape/lib`, `sys/src/ape/cmd`

**APExp does NOT install to the filesystem root.** It installs into the local repo directory tree (e.g., `amd64/lib/ape/`, `amd64/bin/ape/`), then `apexp-sh` overlays these via Plan9 union mounts at runtime.

### Running APExp

```sh
# Launch a shell with APExp overlaid on the native APE environment
./apexp-sh
```

### Supported Architectures

386, 68020, amd64, arm, arm64, mips, power, power64, sparc, sparc64, spim

Architecture-specific code lives under `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/arch/[archname]/`.

### Compiler Configuration

`sys/src/ape/config` defines the APE build environment:
- `CC=pcc` (Plan9 C compiler, not gcc)
- `CFLAGS=-Fw`
- Binaries install to `/$objtype/bin/ape`
- Helper scripts install to `/rc/bin/ape`

### libap (Core Library)

`sys/src/ape/lib/ap/` is reorganized to mirror the musl libc source layout. Key subdirectories:

- `stdio/` — migrated to musl implementation
- `thread/` — POSIX pthread implementation on Plan9
- `aio/` — async I/O
- `math/`, `complex/`, `fenv/` — C99 math
- `network/`, `select/` — network APIs
- `arch/` — per-architecture assembly/C implementations

Multiple upstream libraries are **merged into libap**: lib9, libbsd, libutf, libfmt, libv, libmp, libnet.

### Headers

`sys/include/ape/` contains APE/POSIX headers sourced from: musl libc, NetBSD (libnbcompat), OpenBSD (queue.h via sbase), GNU, and custom Plan9 shims.

## Compiler Enhancements

The Plan9 C compilers (`sys/src/cmd/[1-9]c/`) have been patched extensively for C99/C11/C23 compatibility:

- **C99:** VLA, compound literals, hex floats, complex numbers, `//` comments, `_Bool`, designated initializers, `__alignof__`, `_Generic` (C11/C23), unicode escapes
- **Bitfield support** (from @jamoson's kencc patch)
- **GAS-compatible `as` front-end** to native Plan9 assemblers (vibe-coded)

When editing compiler sources, changes affect all architectures — the compilers share common front-end code in `sys/src/cmd/cc/` with arch-specific backends.

## Minimizing the Build

The default build is intentionally "bloated" to catch bugs early. To build a minimal subset, comment out subdirectories in the relevant mkfiles:

- `sys/src/ape/lib/mkfile` — disable libraries
- `sys/src/ape/cmd/mkfile` — disable utilities

Safe to disable: non-C language libraries, transpilers (f2c, p2c, objc), archivers.

## Testing

Minimal test infrastructure at `sys/lib/tests/stdio-test.c`. Testing is primarily ad-hoc: compile a program under APExp and verify it builds/runs correctly.

## Current Development Focus (as of 2026-04)

- POSIX threading (`pthread`) — `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/thread/` (uncommitted: `cond_timedwait.c`)
- Async I/O (`aio`) — `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/aio/aio.c` (uncommitted)
- C11/C23 compiler features — `_Generic` support recently added
- pthread header — `sys/include/ape/pthread.h` (uncommitted modifications)

# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

APExp (APE with experimental patches) is an enhanced ANSI/POSIX compatibility layer for Plan9/9front. Its goal is maximal GNU/POSIX compatibility — the pragmatic opposite of Plan9's NIH philosophy — so that C programs written for UNIX can be built on Plan9 with minimal modification.

**Important:** APExp is intentionally unstable between releases. Breaking changes are expected between releases; the best option for users is to download the latest release.

## Build System

The build tool is `mk` (Plan9's native make equivalent). Mkfiles use rc shell syntax, not POSIX sh.

```sh
# Full build and install (run from repo root, on Plan9/9front)
mk install

# Clean build artifacts
mk clean

# clean, plus everything installed into $objtype/bin and $objtype/lib
mk distclean

# Nuke everything -- clean plus each library's $LIB; see the warning below
mk nuke
```

**`mk install` used to need running twice** -- syscalls were not always
integrated into libap on the first pass -- and no longer does.

**Prefer `distclean` to `nuke`, and the reason is specific rather than
general.** `nuke` is `clean` plus `rm -f ... $LIB` (`sys/src/cmd/mksyslib`,
`mklib`, `mkone`), and `$LIB` is `$APEXPROOT/$objtype/lib/ape/libap.a`.
**With `$APEXPROOT` empty that is `/$objtype/lib/ape/libap.a`** -- an
absolute path into the host's own stock APE, not into this tree. Every
mkfile here assigns `APEXPROOT` itself as a literal, so it takes a
command-line override or a bad edit to get there; the exposure is one
named file per library directory rather than a tree, so the failure is
bounded, but it is a real way to delete something outside the repo and
there is no reason to run into it. `distclean` removes only
`./$arch/bin` and `./$arch/lib`, looping over the **literal** `$_ARCHS`
list, so no expansion can produce an absolute path.

**Those two trees are build output in full.** `git ls-files amd64` is
`amd64/include/ape` and nothing else, and `.gitignore` carries
`*/bin/*` and `*/lib/*` for every architecture -- which is why
`distclean` can remove them outright and `install` recreates them with
its own `mkdir -p`.

**An ABI change still needs the full removal before the rebuild**, and
`distclean` is the way to ask for it: nothing in these mkfiles lists a
system header as a dependency, so `mk` will not rebuild an object
because `<sys/select.h>` changed. See the `HFILES` note in
`docs/notes/tk-plan9.md` for what a half-rebuilt shared struct looks
like from the outside.

The install target:
1. Removes old arch-specific lib/ape files
2. Creates output directories for all 11 supported architectures
3. Runs `./mount-include` to bind APExp headers over the system headers via union mount
4. Recursively builds: `sys/src/cmd`, `sys/src/ape/9src`, `sys/src/ape/lib`, `sys/src/ape/cmd`

**APExp does NOT install to the filesystem root.** It installs into the local repo directory tree (e.g., `amd64/lib/ape/`, `amd64/bin/ape/`), then `apexp-sh` overlays these via Plan9 union mounts at runtime.

### Running APExp

```sh
# Launch a shell with APExp overlaid on the native APE environment
./apexp-sh
```

### Supported Architectures

386, 68020, amd64, arm, arm64, mips, power, power64, sparc, sparc64, spim

The current architecture defined by the variable $objtype, for example $objtype=amd64 for x86_64.

Architecture-specific code for libap.a lives under `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/arch/$objtype/`.

### Compiler Configuration

`sys/src/ape/config` defines the APE build environment:
- `CC=pcc` (Plan9 C compiler, not gcc)
- `CFLAGS=-Fw`
- Binaries install to `/$objtype/bin/ape`
- Helper scripts install to `/rc/bin/ape`

### libap (Core Library)

`sys/src/ape/lib/ap/` is reorganized to mirror the musl libc source layout. Key subdirectories:

- `stdio/` — migrated to musl implementation
- `thread/` — POSIX pthread implementation on Plan9
- `aio/` — async I/O
- `math/`, `complex/`, `fenv/` — C99 math
- `network/`, `select/` — network APIs
- `arch/` — per-architecture assembly/C implementations

Multiple upstream libraries are **merged into libap**: lib9, libbsd, libutf, libfmt, libv, libmp, libnet.

### Headers

`sys/include/ape/` contains APE/POSIX headers sourced from: musl libc, NetBSD (libnbcompat), OpenBSD (queue.h via sbase), GNU, and custom Plan9 shims.
`$objtype/include/ape/` contains APE/POSIX headers that are architecture-dependent

## Compiler Enhancements

The Plan9 C compilers (`sys/src/cmd/[1-9]c/`) have been patched extensively for C99/C11/C23 compatibility:

- **C99:** VLA, compound literals, hex floats (lexed since the start, but *converted* only since the `hexfloat()` fix -- see `docs/notes/kencc.md`), complex numbers, `//` comments, `_Bool`, designated initializers, `__alignof__`, `_Generic` (C11/C23), unicode escapes
- **Bitfield support** (from @jamoson's kencc patch)
- **GAS-compatible `as` front-end** to native Plan9 assemblers (vibe-coded with claude.ai)

When editing compiler sources, changes affect all architectures — the compilers share common front-end code in `sys/src/cmd/cc/` with arch-specific backends.

## Minimizing the Build

The default build is intentionally "bloated" to catch bugs early. To build a minimal subset, comment out subdirectories in the relevant mkfiles:

- `sys/src/ape/lib/mkfile` — disable libraries
- `sys/src/ape/cmd/mkfile` — disable utilities

Safe to disable: non-C language libraries, transpilers (f2c, p2c, objc), archivers.

## Testing

`sys/lib/tests/` holds standalone programs, each built and run by hand:

```
cd sys/lib/tests && pcc -o bool-test bool-test.c && ./bool-test
```

The convention: print `PASS`/`FAIL` per case, exit with the number of
failures, and open with a comment saying which bug the test came from
and what it cost. `tk-childproc-test.tcl` is the exception to the C
convention -- it is a Tcl script, run with `wish`, because the thing it
reproduces is Tk spawning a second Tk. Anything testing a language or library rule should be
correct on gcc too — checking a new test against gcc first is how you
find out whether the test or the tree is wrong, and it has caught both.

Every test named in `docs/notes/` sits here; the ones for kencc
itself are `bool-test.c`, `bitfield-test.c`, `compound-assign-test.c`,
`compound-literal-test.c`, `designated-init-test.c`, `charptr-test.c`,
`rol64-test.c` and `u64float-test.c`, and for libap `locale-test.c`,
`sigset-test.c`, `posix-spawn-test.c`, `limits-test.c`,
`format-arg-test.c`, `unget-pipe-test.c`, `isatty-test.c`,
`execve-env-test.c`, `tz-test.c`, `rename-test.c`, `listenleak-test.c`,
`sincos-test.c`, `explog-test.c`, `fparith-test.c`,
`float-overflow-test.c`, `malloc-reuse-test.c`,
`socket-server-test.c`, `dup-fdinfo-test.c`, `rmdir-test.c`,
`copyfile-test.c`, `deeppath-test.c` and `stdio-test.c`. The twenty-five `tk-*.tcl` scripts there are Tcl, run
with `wish` -- except `tk-menubar-test.tcl`, which needs `tktest` and
skips itself under `wish`, and `tk-transient-test.tcl`, whose last
section alone does; see `docs/notes/tk-plan9.md`. `tk-runall.tcl` is the harness for
Tk's own suite rather than a test of its own, and `tk-runtest.tcl` runs
a single file from it. `tcl-runall.tcl` is the same thing for Tcl's own
suite, run under `tcltest`; both harnesses exist because a fault, a
kill and a clean finish are indistinguishable from the shell, so a run
without a completion marker cannot be read at all.
`tcl-fileevent-test.tcl` is a test rather than a harness -- it runs
under plain `tclsh` and isolates the `chan-io-44.1` and `event-11.5`
hangs, with a timeout on every section so it reports where the suite
would wait; `select-test.c` takes the two bugs it found down to the
`select()` call underneath them.
`tz-xcheck.c` is not a Plan 9 test at all: it links
`lib/ap/time/tzone.c` into a **glibc** program on the build host and
sweeps ~1.4 million instants against `localtime_r`, so libap's own
parser can be checked without a VM round. It found two bugs that way.
That pattern -- link the unit under test into a host program beside the
reference implementation -- is worth reaching for whenever the thing
being written is a pure function of its input.
`sys/src/ape/lib/libressl/test/` is separate: it is
upstream's own ML-KEM and SHA-3 vectors, run by `mk test` there.

Beyond that, testing is still mostly ad-hoc — compile a program under
APExp and see whether it builds and runs.

## Current Development Focus (as of 2026-09)

- POSIX threading (`pthread`) — `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/thread/`
- Async I/O (`aio`) — `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/aio/aio.c`
- C11/C23 compiler features — `_Generic`, and `bool` as a real type
- perl 5.42.2 — see the section below

### perl

`sys/src/ape/lib/perl` builds `libperl.a`; `sys/src/ape/cmd/perl` builds
`miniperl`, uses it to generate `perlmain.c`, links `perl`, and installs
the module library into `sys/lib/perl` (config.h's `PRIVLIB`).

Working: the interpreter runs, module loading works, and
`ExtUtils::Miniperl` generates `perlmain.c`.

**No XS extensions.** Plan 9 has no dlopen, so `usedl` is empty,
`dlsrc` is `dl_none.xs`, `xs_init` in `perlmain.c` has an empty body,
and only the pure-perl `dist/` and `cpan/` trees are installed — the
fourteen with a `.xs` are deliberately left out, listed in the mkfile.
A `.pm` that dies in `XSLoader` is worse than one that is absent.
PathTools is the exception: `File::Spec` is pure perl and `Cwd.pm` takes
a pure-perl path when DynaLoader is missing.

**`Config.pm` is hand-maintained**, at `sys/src/ape/cmd/perl/Config.pm`.
APExp does not run `Configure`, so there is no `config.sh` for `configpm`
to read; it is the companion to the hand-answered
`sys/src/external/perl/config.h` and has to be kept in step with it. It
provides `%Config` plus `import`, `myconfig`, `_V` (which `perl -V`
calls, at perl.c:2356), `config_vars`, `config_sh` and `config_re`.

**Getting perl to run at all turned up four bugs, and only one was
perl's.** They are worth reading as a set, because three of them were
silent:

- `bool` was a signed char in kencc, so every conversion to it truncated
  — see `docs/notes/kencc.md`. This is why miniperl compiled programs and
  then executed nothing.
- `setlocale` reported a locale it had not set — see libap, locale/.
- `<stdio.h>` leaked errno, unistd, fcntl and pthread, and libap itself
  relied on the leak.
- perl's `config.h` claimed an 80-bit long double. kencc has none:
  `sub.c`'s `simplet()` maps `BDOUBLE|BLONG` to `types[TDOUBLE]`, so
  `long double` is `double`. `NVTYPE` is `double`, `NVSIZE` 8, the
  `NVef`/`NVff`/`NVgf` formats lose their `L`, `USE_LONG_DOUBLE` is off,
  and the `LONGDBL*` byte patterns and mantissa bit counts follow. A
  format asking printf for a type nothing passes it is how `use 5.006`
  came out as "Invalid version format (non-numeric data)".

## The detailed notes

**This file is read in full at the start of every session, so it is kept
short on purpose.** The history -- every bug, what it cost, and how it was
found -- lives under `docs/notes/`, one file per area. Read the one that
covers what you are about to touch; do not re-derive from scratch.

| file | what is in it |
|---|---|
| `docs/notes/kencc.md` | the Plan 9 compilers: every patch to `cc`, `[1-9]c`, `[1-9]l` and `cpp`, C99/C11/C23 status, and the silent code-generation bugs (the 6c spill, the sign of zero, hex floats, `bool`, mixed-signedness `op=`) |
| `docs/notes/libap.md` | `sys/src/ape/lib/ap/` by directory: locale, math, malloc, thread, signal, process, aio |
| `docs/notes/invariants.md` | the traps that bite silently: ABI widths, variadic sentinels, missing prototypes, `free()`'s contract, amd64 setjmp/longjmp, the FP environment, header search order, and the stdio bugs found through flex |
| `docs/notes/tk-plan9.md` | the `sys/src/external/tk/plan9/` backend and Tk's own suite, runs 1 to 16. Also the `HFILES` trap and the gcc syntax check, which apply tree-wide |
| `docs/notes/tcl-suite.md` | Tcl's suite: the allocator, sockets and the missing loopback, `shutdown()`, `listen()`, `select()` and `ap/plan9/_buf.c`, `fd_set`, and the `chan-io` hangs |

Two more under `docs/`, which are surveys rather than history:
`posix-coverage.md` (what of POSIX/musl is present, missing or stubbed,
compared file by file against musl's `src/`) and
`compiler-improvements.md` (the state of the Plan 9 C compilers and what
is still open). `docs/releases/` holds the release notes.

**When a round finishes, the finding goes in the topic file and only the
one-line consequence comes back here.** That is what keeps this file from
growing back to the 8000 lines it was.

## Method: rules that each cost at least one round

These are distilled from the notes above; each one is a mistake that was
actually made here, most of them more than once. The evidence for each is
in the topic file.

**Reading a log**

- **A log's last line is not where the run stopped.** Four separate
  causes: block buffering; a child whose stdout is a pipe; a marker that
  could not print; and `-verbose t` being off, so only *failures* print
  and the last failure is not the last test.
- **`-verbose t` is what makes "last printed" mean "last started".**
  Without it a log cannot be read for position at all.
- **A fault, a kill and a clean finish all just give the shell prompt
  back.** Hence the completion marker in `tk-runall.tcl` and
  `tcl-runall.tcl`; check for it before reading any total.
- **A marker says the run reached the end, not that it was the run you
  asked for.** Read the `Total` line beside it.
- **A constraint says what a test *needs*; only the log says whether it
  ran.** Three tests were written off for three rounds on a constraint
  line while `---- chan-io-41.7 start` sat in the log.
- **A crash or freeze after test N is evidence about N only if nothing
  between N and the stop could have armed it.**
- **Compare runs per file, never by total.** A total cannot tell "nine
  fixed" from "fifteen fixed and six broken"; diff the failing test
  *names*.
- **A rising failure count after new tests become runnable is newly
  *measured*, not newly broken.**
- **And its coin's other face: a test that newly FAILS may be one that
  was passing for the wrong reason.** Before blaming the change in hand,
  read what the test asserts and ask whether anything else in its file
  moved. `socket_inet-5.1` wants a port bind refused, and a leftover
  listener had been refusing it.

**Before believing a result**

- **A measurement of a build that does not contain the change measures
  nothing.** Three instances, two of which nearly reversed a correct
  decision. `git merge-base --is-ancestor <fix> origin/main` before
  reading anything, and number the sections of a hand-built test so the
  output says which source ran.
- **And its opposite face: a build that DOES contain the change cannot
  tell you the change was needed.** A green run looks the same for a fix
  that was necessary and one that was not. To ask *that*, replicate the
  old code beside the new -- which is usually cheaper than a rebuild.
- **When a run comes back green, ask what the new case would have
  printed and look for it.** A test that could not run is
  indistinguishable from one that passed.
- **A fix that demonstrably changed the output has still not been shown
  to fix the test.** Two of `env-2.1`'s three unwanted lines went away
  and not one count moved: a test comparing exactly does not care how
  much of the difference is left. Count what remains before calling a
  cluster closed.
- **A check that cannot fail is not a check** -- and its twin, a check
  that can PASS for the wrong reason, and its other twin, a check whose
  *negative* result has two explanations.
- **A test that draws its own conclusion must do the arithmetic the
  reader would**, or it reports a refutation where there is a
  confirmation.

**Diagnosing**

- **Ask the harness which test before reasoning about which mechanism.**
  Five times a confident mechanism was wrong and one printed
  intermediate settled it in a single run.
- **Print what the machine says rather than what the code implies.** The
  missing loopback, the announce spelling and the `fd_set` width were all
  settled that way after rounds of reasoning went the wrong way.
- **An asynchronous call returning 0 says it was ACCEPTED, not done.**
  `kill()` posts a note; the target dies later and its descriptors close
  later still. A closed listener's port stayed held for exactly that
  reason, and the fix was a wait, not a different approach.
- **Predict the OBSERVATION, never the conclusion.** "Kill succeeds and
  the port is held -> therefore revert" smuggled a mechanism into what
  looked like a reading rule, and nearly threw away a working fix on the
  strength of my own earlier sentence.
- **A grep hit is a name, not an implementation.** Open the function.
- **When a constant is wrong, grep for EVERY definition of it.**
  `PATH_MAX` had two, and the second was in a file the first one
  includes at its own last line.
- **Replicate the code in the tree, line by line, not the code you
  remember.** A probe written from a recollection of `DoCopyFile`
  skipped its `unlink(dst)` and so reported 0 failures for a copy that
  did not work -- a probe that skips a call cannot clear it.
- **Plan 9 has `ratrace`**, and it names a failing system call outright
  where elimination takes rounds. It found the `utime()` return-value
  bug in one run, after six readings of the source had chased an errno
  the failing call never set.
- **Read what a test *compares*, not what it mentions.**
- **A fact that contradicts the diagnosis is not a loose end to come
  back to.** `HOME` was missing from a child's environment in the very
  first log, which alone refuted the `/env` leak; it was filed as an
  anomaly and four more source files were read looking for what had
  hidden it. Nothing had.
- **A flag one letter from another flag is checked, not recalled**, and
  a comment restating what a call does is a claim like any other.
  `RFCENVG` was read as "copy the group" from a comment I had written
  myself, and a committed change rested on it.
- **Every case expected to return must come before every case expected to
  hang**, in file order, each behind a flushed marker naming the
  statement about to run.
- **A freeze and a timeout are different evidence**: a timeout proves the
  event loop still ran, a freeze proves the process is blocked in a call.
- **Blocked and spinning are different bugs**: constant *light* CPU is a
  wait, a pinned core is a loop.
- **A bisect that narrows to nothing is evidence** -- of a cumulative
  cause -- not a failed bisect.
- **When upstream does something from an event, ask what the event costs
  in time before reimplementing it as a call**, and the reverse. Copying
  upstream's mechanism is not copying its timing.
- **A fix that makes a process reach code it never reached before can
  expose anything on that path.**

**Writing the code**

- **A stub that answers "failure" is not the same as one that answers
  "nothing to do"**, and a stub that does nothing is not the same as a
  platform with nothing to do. This family (`XLoadFont`, `wm title`,
  `testembed`, `TkUnixSetMenubar`, `shutdown`, an errno naming the wrong
  category) is the single most common bug in this tree.
- **A platform having nothing to *display* is no reason for a value not
  to read back.**
- **The condition is not the operating system, it is that there is no X
  server** -- so `PLAN9` belongs in upstream's own `_WIN32 || MAC_OSX_TK`
  lists, not in a forked copy of a generic file.
- **Do not invent semantics to make a test pass.** No `bind()` fallback
  to `*`, no error on an empty `/dev/snarf`, no unmapping of
  descendants, no fabricated install paths.
- **When a struct is recycled, reset every field that means something**,
  not just the ones about the data.
- **A table keyed on a descriptor NUMBER needs invalidating when the
  number is retired, and there is no single place that happens.**
  `dup2()` and raw `_CLOSE()` retire one without going through
  `close()`. Key on something the file itself carries (`dev`/`ino`), or
  a stale entry will be believed -- one SIGKILL'd the wrong process and
  froze a suite.
- **Append to a shared global struct, never insert** -- and see the
  `HFILES` rule below.
- **Err towards more damage** when repairing pixels: too much costs a
  repaint, too little cannot be corrected.

**Build system**

- **A header not in `HFILES` is a header `mk` does not rebuild for.** A
  logically inert change followed by broad, unattributable breakage is a
  layout problem; ask which objects were actually recompiled.
- **An ABI change needs `mk distclean` before `mk install`**; no mkfile
  here lists a system header as a dependency. **The same goes for a
  library change that has to reach an existing binary**: `mk install`
  rebuilds `libap.a` without relinking programs already built against
  it, so a libap fix can sit unused for rounds. Prefer `distclean` to
  `nuke` (see the Build System section).
- **Check every object built against a library for the flags that library
  was built with**, not just the ones the linker complained about.
  `nm -g --defined-only x.o | wc -l` is a one-second check.
- **Prefer the link over the patch** when missing symbols live in a file
  the upstream tree already ships.
- **When the library already does the thing you are adding, copy the
  whole idiom, not the call.** `_closebuf` was cited for `SIGKILL`; the
  signal was taken and the loop that waits for the death was left
  behind, which cost two rounds.
- **Put a test binary in the directory whose flags it shares** -- but it
  does not follow that every object in it takes the same flags.
- **A macro's identity includes whether there is white space.** Copy an
  upstream spelling character for character, and guard it; and grep the
  mkfiles for `-D<name>=` before adding a name to an APE header.
- **Syntax-check vendored backends on the host with gcc before shipping**
  (the command is in `docs/notes/tk-plan9.md`); gcc is stricter than pcc
  and a round trip to the VM costs a full rebuild.
- **A Tcl list literal has to survive rc first.** `{}` is a block, `()`
  is a list, only `''` quotes.

**Testing**

- Check a new test against gcc or a Linux `tclsh` *first*: it tells you
  whether the test or the tree is wrong, and it has caught both. It
  caught a *third* thing in `tz-test.c`: that POSIX lets `localtime_r`
  skip the `tzset()` a `localtime` must do, and glibc takes it
  literally. The test asserted otherwise and the library was about to
  match the test.
- **Better still, link the code under test into a host program beside
  the reference implementation.** A test run on glibc passes by asking
  glibc for the answers; it says nothing about your parser until it
  reaches the VM. `tz-xcheck.c` linked `tzone.c` into a glibc program
  and swept 1.4M instants -- two bugs, two recompiles, no rebuilds.
  Applies to anything that is a pure function of its input.
- Anything asking about one operating system's own behaviour is a probe,
  not a library rule -- report it, do not assert it.
- Write the prediction down before the run, including what would refute
  it. The honest tally in these notes runs about one in eight for
  mechanisms guessed from code alone.

## Known invariants, one line each

The reasoning for all of these is in `docs/notes/invariants.md`; this is
the index, so that nothing here is a surprise.

- `size_t`/`ssize_t` are 64-bit on amd64 and `long` is not.
- `sizeof` is 32-bit, so a call with **no prototype in scope** corrupts
  the argument. An argument that arrives half right means a missing
  prototype.
- A variadic sentinel must be a pointer, never `0`.
- `free()` needs exactly the pointer `malloc()` returned.
- `longjmp` must never write to the stack; `main9.s` must use only
  caller-saved registers.
- Any startup path bypassing `main9.s` must set the POSIX FP environment.
- `/$objtype/include/ape` is searched **before** `/sys/include/ape`, so
  stock APE's per-architecture `float.h`, `stdarg.h` and `stdint.h`
  shadow this tree unless a real file shadows them back.
- Adding an entry to `_errno.c`'s table changes control flow, because
  `bind()` gates its fallback on `EPLAN9`.
- `RFCENVG`, `RFCNAMEG` and `RFCFDG` create **empty** groups; the `C` is
  *clear*. `RFENVG`, `RFNAMEG` and `RFFDG` are the ones that copy. So
  `execve` has no environment at all after its first line.
- `/dev/snarf` is the clipboard and has no concept of ownership.
- Plan 9 has no loopback unless `ip/ipconfig loopback /dev/null 127.1`
  has been run -- and that belongs in the machine's startup, not in
  `apexp-sh`.

## Where things stand

**Tk's suite**: 97 files, `Total 10027 Passed 8925 Skipped 924
Failed 178`, clean exit. The remaining 178 are mostly out of reach here
(a second wish process, an X property, a system tray, a scalable font,
or a constraint that fails on Linux too). The port's own share is
`focus-6.1`, `geometry-4.7`, `event-9.13`/`9.14` and `visual-3.1`.

**Tcl's suite**: **it finishes and nothing aborts.**
`Total 68118 Passed 62070 Skipped 5887 Failed 161`, 167 files, marker,
exit 0, and no `Test files exiting with errors` section.

**A count in the per-file table is executions, not tests**: `clock`'s
16 were 4 tests run twice each (`.vm:0`/`.vm:1`). Size a cluster from
the names, not the number.

Open, in order of what the next run should touch:

- **`env` 9: understood, and not ours.** All nine are one line,
  `path=/bin<0x01>.`, in a child's environment. Tcl never unsets `path`
  (`envprep` keeps anything whose upper case is in its keep-list, which
  has `PATH`), and the child's filter `lrem` removes **one** match --
  while this environment has two spellings, rc's `path` and the `PATH`
  that `apexp-sh` sets for bash. Checked on a host `tclsh`. Do not fix
  by hiding `path`. The `_fdinfo`/`_sighdlr` leak into `environ` **is**
  fixed and confirmed. **The `execve` half was withdrawn: there was no
  second bug.** `RFCENVG` creates an *empty* environment group -- the
  `C` is *clear*, `RFENVG` is the one that copies -- so `execve` already
  delivered exactly `envp`, and the loop added to clear `/env` was
  removing an empty directory on every exec. `execve-env-test`'s
  section 3 measured it in one run without rebuilding libap.
- **`posix_spawnp` discards the `envp` it is handed**: libap's `spawn()`
  tests `usepath` first and the child calls `execvp`, which passes
  `environ`. POSIX says `envp` is the child's environment either way.
  Recorded, not fixed, not measured. Tcl's `exec` is the caller.
- **`clock` 16 -> 0, CONFIRMED**, and nothing else moved: `Passed` +8,
  `Total` and `Skipped` identical, no new failure anywhere -- so `%Z`
  printing the real zone name instead of always `EST`/`EDT` broke
  nothing. The cause: `$TZ` reached nothing.
  `tzset()` parsed `getenv("timezone")`, Plan 9's spelling, while
  `localtime_r` separately read `/env/timezone` **once per process** into
  a static of its own, and neither had heard of `TZ`. Nothing set
  `tm_gmtoff`/`tm_zone` either, so `strftime`'s `%Z` was a hardcoded
  `{"EST","EDT"}` ("hack for now: assume eastern time zone") and `%z`
  did not exist. `time/tzone.c` is now the single engine -- POSIX TZ
  strings with DST rules, `/env/timezone` as the fallback, UTC with an
  **empty** name when neither parses. **`%Z` changing for every zone is
  the thing to watch beyond `clock`.** No zoneinfo, so
  `TZ=America/New_York` is UTC; glibc does the same here without tzdata.
- **`fCmd` 35 -> 22, CONFIRMED, and everything left is out of reach.**
  The 16 that went were the two bugs: `rename()` of a directory into a
  *different* directory always failed (the cross-directory copy path did
  `_CREATE(to, OWRITE, s->mode)` and a directory cannot be opened for
  writing), which also produced the "invalid operation" two *permission*
  tests were reading; plus `EINVAL` for a directory moved into itself,
  compared **by qid up the tree, not by string**; plus `_errno.c` mapping
  Plan 9's "permission denied" to `EPERM` where POSIX wants `EACCES`.
  The remaining 22 + `unixFCmd` 2 are 15 symlink, 8 `~USER`, and
  `unixFCmd-1.1`. **24 of 24 accounted for** -- reading a cluster all
  the way through before touching it is what made that possible.
- **`close()` on a listening socket freed nothing -- fixed, not yet
  confirmed.** `listen()` replaces the descriptor with a **pipe** and
  forks a child holding the real network fd, so `close()` shut a pipe
  while the announcement lived in another process. `_killmuxsid` only
  kills that group at `exit()`, which is no help to a program that keeps
  running and none at all to a run ended by a note. **This is the
  hundred leaked `listenproc` processes**, and it was found by one
  command: `socket -server ... 1` in a fresh `tclsh` answered `address
  already in use` for a port the previous run had bound and closed.
  `_sock_listenpid.c` records the pid; `close()` kills it, **only if
  `getpid()` matches the recorded owner** -- the table is inherited by
  every fork, which is the trap `_buf.c` records in capitals.
  **The first version froze the suite in `chanio.test` at low CPU**: it
  keyed the table on the descriptor NUMBER, which `dup2()` and raw
  `_CLOSE()` retire without clearing, so a stale pid could SIGKILL a
  live unrelated process -- and `kill()` opens `/proc/N/note` and
  *closes* it, re-entering the function on a fresh number every time.
  Now keyed on `dev`/`ino` and checked with `fstat()`, plus a
  re-entrancy flag. **The hang is `chan-io-29.34`**, named by
  `-verbose t`: it closes the listener and only THEN waits for the
  *accepted* connection to drain, so the question is whether ending the
  listening process disturbs a connection already accepted.
  `listenleak-test` section 3 asks exactly that in C, with a ten-second
  timeout per blocking call so it reports instead of freezing.
  **The port is STILL held after a rebuild**, and two mechanisms argued
  from the source were both wrong (`fstat` does not go through
  `_fdinfo`; `_closebuf` does not close the descriptor). So
  `$APEXP_LISTENDEBUG=1` now makes `_sock_listenpid.c` print one line
  per decision -- recorded / killing / STALE / NOT OURS / kill FAILED.
  That run said: **the kill happens, returns 0, and the port is STILL
  held** -- which I had pre-committed to reading as "revert". Wrong
  stop-condition: `kill()` POSTS a note and returns; the listener dies
  asynchronously and its descriptors close later still. `_closebuf` has
  had the idiom for this all along -- `for(i=0; i<10 &&
  kill(pid,SIGKILL)==0; i++) _SLEEP(1);` -- which is a **wait**, not a
  retry: it ends when `kill` fails, i.e. when the process is gone.
  `_sock_killlisten` does that now (mark 3).
- **`socket_inet-5.1`/`5.3` were passing for the WRONG REASON** -- a
  leftover listener was refusing the bind, not the system -- so they are
  not a regression from the errno change. Expect them to **stay
  failing** once ports are genuinely released: `notRoot` tests a user
  *name* as a proxy for a capability, and glenda is the host owner.
  **Clear the leftovers (or reboot) before the next suite run**, or the
  first run after the fix still meets a process that predates it.
- **Still unread: `io` 23, `chan-io` 19, `socket_inet` 16,
  `filename` 17, `socket` 10.** `filename`'s are all `Tcl_GlobCmd`.
- **`file home ~USER` / `file tildeexpand ~USER`**, ten tests. Needs a
  password database mapping a user to a home directory, which Plan 9
  has not -- read it before writing it off.
- **A failed `execve()` leaves `/env` empty**, on top of rewriting
  `_fdinfo`/`_sighdlr` and closing every `FD_CLOEXEC` descriptor. This
  is old, not new: `_RFORK(RFCENVG)` on its first line is what empties
  it. `environ` is untouched, so it is bounded.
- `chan-io-6.4x`: `-buffersize 16` with `testchannel inputbuffered`
  reporting 0. The oldest open item here.
- `binary-53.25`/`53.26`: a double one ulp past the float range must
  round to infinity.
- **9front has no symbolic links** (confirmed by grep), so `symlink()`
  stays ENOSYS and costs one test. **Do not emulate it with a copy** --
  see `docs/notes/tcl-suite.md`.

**Fixed this round**: `NAME_MAX` was 27 and `PATH_MAX` 1023, set in
`sys/include/ape/sys/limits.h`, which `<limits.h>` includes at its very
end and which `#undef`s and redefines what the outer file had just set.
255 and 4096 now. **The header marker in `deeppath-test` is what found
it** -- it reported `came from THIS TREE` while the numbers stayed
stock-looking, which refuted my own architecture-directory diagnosis.
**When a constant is wrong, grep for every definition of it.**

**And the deep-path abort was cleared by the full rebuild, not by any
constant** -- most likely the `fts_alloc` fix from four rounds ago
finally reaching `tcltest`, which gives the new build rule below.

**Not ours**: `unixFCmd-1.1` wants `EACCES` from walking *through* a
mode-0 directory; Plan 9 answers "does not exist". The file server's
choice, so a probe rather than a library rule.

**Smaller open items**: `unlink()` of a directory reports `EPLAN9`
where POSIX allows EPERM or EISDIR.

**Open hazards recorded but not measured**: the lost wakeup in
`select()`'s rendezvous (a copy process reaching EOF before the parent
sets `selwait`). *(The `_closebuf` "kills ten times without waiting"
entry was withdrawn: the loop IS the wait -- it ends when `kill` fails
-- and misreading it is what left `_sock_killlisten` without one.)* *(The third -- a closed `socket -server`
leaving its `listenproc` for ever -- was measured and fixed; see above.
It had sat here unmeasured while it silently decided the result of two
tests.)*

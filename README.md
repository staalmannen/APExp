# APExp
Plan9 (9front) APE with experimental patches (a.k.a APExp)

**Abstract**


With the advent of NPE as a superior compatibility layer using system libraries
and a thin shim, the need for the traditional APE will become less critical
for building the base system in the future. Instead of this becoming the 
death of APE, I would argue that it frees up alternative use cases for it 
when APE stops being an integral part of the base 9front system: NPE
aims to be as small, neat and native as possible, only aiming to build some
alien software. In contrast, I aim to make this free APE something bigger, 
messier (and some would say uglier) with the purpose of an as complete POSIX
compatibility as possible. Ideally will any (C and possibly transpiled-to-C) 
program built for UNIX be a simple configure/make away from being built on 
9front with APExp.


**Fighting the Knights that say NIH**


The Not-invented-here (NIH) attitude is common in fringe hobbyist/research
software communities. This attitude has a certain virtue to it, because it
"forces" a development model to adapt to the unique features and advantages
of the alternative operating system. In many ways, this kind of elitism does
serve a purpose - especially to keep the base system clean and philosophically
coherent. As with any ideology or virtue, however, it can easily be perverted
when applied *in absurdum*. As an opposing ideology stands the pragmatic
live-and-let-live "*do as Ãžou wilt*", where enabling people to do anything with
their system is seen as a good thing.


APE (Ansi Posix Environment) has historically been a compatibility layer to
build or port legacy UNIX applications to Plan9 [1]. Recently, an interesting
alternative to APE has been developed on 9front (the most actively developed
fork of Plan9) - NPE, which aims to fill a similar niche but with a much more
limited scope [2,3,4]. There is however definitely also a need for a more
complete, messier and complex compatibility layer even if it is not included
in the base system. A small community will never be able to produce and
maintain software on par with what is available in the wider open source
ecosystem. One nice example of this is the Netsurf port [5,6], which by far is
the most capable web browser available on Plan9.


**Modifications made to APE**


At this moment, just imported the latest 9front APE sources from git [x]
In addition, several patches from @lufia [x1, x2] to build libressl and curl
(introduces pthread, include_next cpp support, etc) has been applied to the
sources.
- APE make has been replaced by a port of GNU make (version 3.82)

which fits both with the bunny theme of Glenda and the Monty Python Holy Grail reference and "killing knights".

APExp is NOT meant to be copied to the file system root, but rather to be built
from your local check out. The files will be installed in local directories,
which then will be union mounted on top of your existing root using the apexp-sh script.

To install, just write mk install in the top level directory.
At the moment, you will have to do this twice because syscalls are somehow not integrated in libap the first time.



APExp builds on a clean 9front (amd64) VM. Please let me know if any changes are needed to make it build on other Plan9 distros and architectures.

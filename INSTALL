APExp is not meant to be copied to the file system root, but rather to be built
from your local check out. The installed files and headers will overwrite your 
existing APE, but you will still have your original APE source code.

Copying APExp to / will lead to some problems, for example will 
sys/src/cmd/mkfile overwrite /sys/src/cmd/mkfile, which will mess up building 
the rest of the programs in that directory.

The aim is to have a top level mkfile that handles building and installation
(currently TODO).

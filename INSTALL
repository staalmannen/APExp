APExp is not meant to be copied to the file system root, but rather to be built
from your local check out. The files will be installed in local directories,
which then will be mounted on top of your existing root using the apexp.rc script.

Copying APExp to / will lead to some problems, for example will 
sys/src/cmd/mkfile overwrite /sys/src/cmd/mkfile, which will mess up building 
the rest of the programs in that directory.

The aim is to have a top level mkfile that handles building and installation
(currently TODO).

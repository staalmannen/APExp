Several 3rd party applications have been imported to replace some custom APE
implementations of UNIX commands.

Everything that enhances POSIX or "GNU de facto standard" compatibility is
welcome in APExp. We might thus integrate more 3rd party content in the
future. Suggestions are welcome

The aim of APExp is to be portable. I should test other distributions of 
Plan9 and multiple architectures to make sure that APExp builds on as many
of them as possible.


* Clean up the dependency mess of gnulib/libiconv/libintl/libgettextpo/libtextstyle/libxml
The same objects often have to be integrated in multiple libraries to satisfy internal dependencies
Would it make sense to just make one huge monster library providing all the GNU stuff?

* Seek and destroy ugly hacks in the code which may have a nicer solution (eyeballs appreciated)

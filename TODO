The aim is to make a top level mkfile to handle building and installation of
APExp. We also need to change paths to relative for things included in APExp,
and to absolute for things pointing towards the host system source tree
which are not included in APExp. Taken together, this should enable APExp
to be relatively free-standing. By using union mounts, we can replace the
host system APE without overwriting it.

Several 3rd party applications have been imported to replace some custom APE
implementations of UNIX commands. Several of these are old ports, and one
task will be to update those ports.

Everything that enhances POSIX or "GNU de facto standard" compatibility is welcome in APExp. We might
thus integrate more 3rd party content in the future. Suggestions are welcome

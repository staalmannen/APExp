 BOOTSTRAP PROCEDURE
 -------------------

1.  "./configure"  or "./configure --prefix=$HOME"

    this will configure objc (the driver script) and
    objc.exe (the driver executable)

    on UNIX, you in fact only need objc (the sh script),
    but objc.exe also works.
    
    on OpenVMS, don't use the configure script, use Makefile.vms and objc.com

2.  "make"
    
    this will build objc1 (platform independent)

3.  "[ su root; ] make install"

    this will copy the executables objc and objc1 into /usr/local/bin
    (or into $HOME/bin if you configured with --prefix=$HOME)

 INSTALLATION PROCEDURE
 ----------------------

4.  "cd $HOME/objc1.7.1"

    download the latest compiler sources and go to that directory

5.  "./configure" or "./configure --prefix=$HOME"

    configure the compiler sources
    this will find the bootstrap compiler that we've built before

6.  "make; [ su root; ] make install"

    replace the bootstrap compiler by the actual compiler


 FUTURE UPGRADES
 ---------------

Only step 4, 5 and 6 are necessary to upgrade a compiler.

<H2>Class Description</H2>
This is an abstract superclass for Array classes, classes that provide some methods like <B>at:</B> or <B>charAt:</B> for indexing their contents, which are elements of some particular C type.  A typical example is the <B>String</B> class.<P>
This abstract class is useful for implementing functionality, that is inherited by such classes as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>IdArray</LI>
<LI>String (ByteArray)</LI>
<LI>IntArray</LI>
</UL>
In addition, this class is necessary for compatibility with Stepstone's ICpak101.<P>
<B>Note:</B> Because the Portable Object Compiler doesn't provide any API for indexed variables, our Array classes, although interface compatible with those of ICpak101, do not allocate their contents as indexed variables.<P>

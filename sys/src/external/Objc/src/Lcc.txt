Portable Object Compiler (c) 1997,98,2002,2003.  All Rights Reserved.


This file contains some notes that are specific to running "objc"
(pronounced as "Object Compiler") on Windows95 or WindowsNT using
the LCC-WIN32 compiler system.

Note: lcc is also available as compiler for UNIX (and is compatible with objc)
      these notes apply only to the WIN32 port of lcc
      (available from http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/)


AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

	Add C:\OBJC\BIN to your PATH.  This directory contains OBJC.EXE
	the compiler driver, and OBJC1.EXE, the compiler proper.  It's
	also assumed that the LCC tools (LCC,LCCLNK,LCCLIB etc.) are in 
	the PATH.
	
	It's also convenient to "set OBJCOPT=options" in this file, where
	options can be "-q" for example.

	If you want to install in a different location than C:\OBJC\BIN,
	then set the OBJCDIR environment variable (points to top directory).

Makefiles
---------

	The Makefiles have a .lcc extension (for lcc make)

	At the top level, there is a .BAT file that drives the process.
	So you type:

		setup lcc
		make

	to start building the different components of the compiler.


BISON & FLEX
------------

	We're using the win32 ports of these tools.  That is,
	the parser and scanner is no longer generated on UNIX (scan.m, parser.m)
	but is now generated on Windows itself from scan.lm and parser.ym.
	
	Flex and Bison for Windows95 are available on http://www.winsite.com.
	They're configured for VisualC++.  I've modified "bison.simple" to 
	include
	(before the top #if __GNUC__) the following lines (to define alloca()
	correctly :)
	
		#if __LCC__
		#include <malloc.h>
		#endif
		
	I've contacted the author of the port, so this might already have
	been fixed meanwhile.

	If you use a different port of flex/bison, check the definition of
	YYLEXC and YTABH/YTABC in the src/objc/Makefile.  It's either y.tab.c
	or y_tab.c

Makefiles
---------

	The Makefiles have a .lcc extension (for the nmake clone that comes
	with lcc)

	For the top level Makefile, just type:

		"make"

	to start building the different components of the compiler.


Binary Driver
-------------

	There's no Bourne shell compiler driver for Windows95.  Only
	the binary, compiled, version is available (as "objc.exe").

Compiling math.h
----------------

	There is a switch -ansic which turns off lcc-win32 extensions.

	You can add this to OBJCOPT in order to compile some programs
	that include <math.h> or other include files.

Portable Object Compiler (c) 1997,2020.  All Rights Reserved.

This file contains some notes that are specific to running "objc"
(pronounced as "Object Compiler") on Windows95, WindowsNT, Windows 98,
Windows XP, Windows 7 or Windows 10 using the Sybase WATCOM compiler.

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

	Add C:\OBJC\BIN to your PATH.  This directory contains OBJC.EXE
	the compiler driver, and OBJC1.EXE, the compiler proper.  It's
	also assumed that the WATCOM tools (WCC386,WLINK etc.) are in 
	the PATH.

	For example,

	PATH=c:\tools\bin;c:\objc\bin;C:\WATCOM\BINNT;%PATH%
	set INCLUDE=C:\WATCOM\H;C:\WATCOM\H\NT
	set WATCOM=C:\WATCOM
	
	It's also convenient to "set OBJCOPT=options" in this file, where
	options can be "-q" for example.

	If you want to install in a different location than C:\OBJC\BIN,
	then set the OBJCDIR environment variable (points to top directory).

Makefiles
---------

	The Makefiles have a .wmk extension (for wmake)

	At the top level, there is a .BAT file that drives the process.
	So you type:

		setup wmk
		make

	to start building the different components of the compiler.

ARWAT.BAT
---------

        There's a script in the 'util' directory to provide a UNIX style
	'ar' interface towards the WATCOM wlib utility.

	Copy this file to a location in the PATH (e.g. c:\objc\bin) if it's
	not already there.

BISON & FLEX
------------

	We're using the win32 ports of these tools.  That is,
	the parser and scanner is no longer generated on UNIX (scan.m, parser.m)
	but is now generated on Windows itself from scan.lm and parser.ym.
	
	Flex and Bison for Windows95 are available on http://www.winsite.com.
	They're configured for VisualC++.  I've modified "bison.simple" to 
	include
	(before the top #if __GNUC__) the following lines (to define alloca()
	correctly :)
	
		#if __WATCOMC__
		#include <malloc.h>
		#endif
		
	I've contacted the author of the port, so this might already have
	been fixed meanwhile.

	If you use a different port of flex/bison, check the definition of
	YYLEXC and YTABH/YTABC in the src/objc/Makefile.  It's either y.tab.c
	or y_tab.c

Garbage Collection
------------------

	The -gc option has been tested on WIN32 with the Boehm library
	(compiled with WATCOM).

	Compile (using the WCC_MAKEFILE in the Boehm package, included
	since 4.12) gc.lib, and copy gc.lib into c:\objc\lib.
	Also copy gc.h into c:\objc\include\objcrt or some place that
	is going to be searched.

Binary Driver
-------------

	There's no Bourne shell compiler driver for Windows.  Only
	the binary, compiled, version is available (as "objc.exe").

Portable Object Compiler (c) 1997,98,2002.  All Rights Reserved.

This file contains some notes that are specific to running "objc"
(pronounced as "Object Compiler") on OS/2 Warp 4 using IBM's
VisualAge for C++ compiler.

AUTOEXEC.BAT
------------

	Add C:\OBJC\BIN to your PATH.  This directory contains OBJC.EXE
	the compiler driver, and OBJC1.EXE, the compiler proper.  It's
	also assumed that the compiler tools (ilib, nmake etc.) are in 
	the PATH.

	It's also convenient to "set OBJCOPT=options" in this file, where
	options can be "-q" for example.

	If you want to install in a different location than C:\OBJC\BIN,
	then set the OBJCDIR environment variable (points to top directory).

Makefiles
---------

	The Makefiles have a .vac extension (for nmake)

	At the top level, there is a .BAT file that drives the process.
	So you type:

		setup vac
		make

	to start building the different components of the compiler.
	
ARVAC.CMD
---------

        There's a script in the 'util' directory to provide a UNIX style
	'ar' interface towards the IBM ilib utility.

	Copy this file to a location in the PATH (e.g. c:\objc\bin) if it's
	not already there.

BISON & FLEX
------------

	We're using the GCC EMX ports of these tools.  That is,
	the parser and scanner are not generated on UNIX (scan.m, parser.m)
	but are now generated on OS/2 itself from scan.lm and parser.ym.
	
	Flex and Bison for OS/2 are available precompiled from
	ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu.
	They're configured for GCC EMX package.  I've modified "bison.simple"
	to include (before the top #if __GNUC__) the following lines
	(to define alloca() correctly :)
	
		#if defined(__IBMCPP__) || defined(__IBMC__)
		#include <malloc.h>
		#endif
		
Garbage Collection
------------------

	The -gc option has NOT been tested on OS/2 with the Boehm library
	(compiled with IBM VisualAge).

Binary Driver
-------------

	There's no Bourne shell compiler driver for OS/2.  Only
	the binary, compiled, version is available (as "objc.exe").

===============================

As mentioned in the NEWS file and documented in a little more detail
in the manual, the MPFR feature is "on parole". This means that the
gawk maintainer (Arnold ROobins) is no longer fixing bugs in the code
or dealing with it.  However, a member of the gawk development team has
volunteered to maintain this code.

As long as this situation works, the MPFR feature will remain part of
the gawk code base. If it changes, then MPFR support will be TOTALLY
REMOVED from the next subsequent gawk release.

-------------------------- DJGPP -----------------------------------

2017-11-13
==========
The DJGPP port of Gawk has been compiled and tested using the
following combinations of MPFR and GMP versions on FreeDOS and
other versions of the DOS operating system:
GNU MPFR 3.1.6, GNU MP 6.1.2

Precompiled binaries of GMP and MPFR for DJGPP are available
from DJ Delorie's ftp server and mirrors:

    http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/gmp612b.zip
    http://www.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2gnu/mpfr316b.zip

No previous versions of these libraries are supported.
Newer versions should work.

------------------------- Mac OS X on PPC -------------------------------

Sat Mar 17 07:32:01 CDT 2012
=============================

The MPFR and GMP versions known to work for Mac OS X on PPC:
GNU MPFR 3.1.0, GNU MP 4.3.1

Wed Nov 15 21:57:29 IST 2017
============================

As of gawk 4.2, MPFR is no longer supported on Mac OS X on PPC.
Gawk switched to C99, and the last PPC version doesn't play well
with C99.

------------------------ Windows MinGW ----------------------------

Precompiled binaries for GMP and MPFR in Windows may be available
from here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/

or here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/mpfr/
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/MinGW/Base/gmp/

You should try to use libraries downloaded from the same site
to avoid possible incompatibilities.

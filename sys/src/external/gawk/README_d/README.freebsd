============================

According to a report from Eric Pruitt <eric.pruitt@gmail.com>:

| When running ./configure for GAWK 4.1.4, the mktime(3) function is not
| detected on FreeBSD 11 when using -static with CFLAGS and LDFLAGS. This
| causes the build to fail.

Paul Eggert says that using:

	./configure ac_cv_func_working_mktime=yes

will cause gawk to use the FreeBSD mktime.

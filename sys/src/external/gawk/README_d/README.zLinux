============================

For z/Linux (CentOS 4, at least), you must fix the optimization level
before compiling:

1. Run configure.
2. Edit the top-level Makefile and extension/Makefile and change -O2 to -O1.
3. Run `make && make check' as usual.

If you don't change the optimization level, the testext test will fail.

In any case, expect the fmtspcl test to fail.

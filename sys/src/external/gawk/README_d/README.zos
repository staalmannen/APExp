GAWK on z/OS

1. To unpack the tarball:

   $ gunzip -c gawk-4.0.0.tar.gz | pax -rv from=ISO8859-1,to=IBM-1047

   This will extract the files and convert them from ASCII to EBCDIC.

   If you do not have the gunzip program on your system you can perform
   the operation on another system and copy the tar file to z/OS. Then
   unpack as follows:

   $ pax -rv from=ISO8859-1,to=IBM-1047 -f gawk-4.0.0.tar


2. To Build

   $ ./configure CC=c89
   $ make

   You will get compilation warnings of the form:

   WARNING CBC3343 ./dfa.c:332   Redeclaration of dfasyntax differs from
   previous declaration on line 404 of "./dfa.h".

   Because the IBM compiler complains when a function is decalared using
   prototypes in the header and is defined without prototypes in the code
   these warnings can be ignored.


3. To Install:

   $ make install


4. To Test (optional):

   $ make check

   NOTE: Since the test suite was defined for an ASCII and IEEE floating point
   environment several of the tests will fail under z/OS.

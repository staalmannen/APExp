============================

If you're interested in the RPM .spec file for gawk from the
Fedora project, you can find it at:

	https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/gawk/blob/master/f/gawk.spec

This is very Fedora-specific; it would need work before it could
used in a more generic fashion, but it might be useful as a
starting point.

Thanks to David Kaspar [Dee'Kej] <dkaspar@redhat.com> for the pointer.

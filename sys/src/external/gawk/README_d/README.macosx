Overall, for both Intel and ARM Mac systems, the best bet is to install
gawk using homebrew or macports.  Building from source runs into problems
with the readline library. On ARM systems, you need to use
`./configure --with-readline=/opt/homebrew/opt/readline'. Otherwise,
using the gawk debugger causes gawk to crash as soon as you enter a line
at the `gawk>' prompt. On Intel systems, we could not find a way to
build gawk so that it wouldn't crash; therefore you would have to use
`./configure --without-readline' to get a usable debugger.  Sheesh.

Building an x86_64 binary on M1 systems was a bad idea. Not all systems
have Rosetta installed, and there are still ppc and ppc64 systems out
in the world. See https://trac.macports.org/ticket/66329.

So for now, PMA in enabled for macOS only on x86_64.

In order to use the new persistent memory feature, it's (currently) necessary
to build gawk as a non-PIE (Position Independent Executable) binary. That
is possible on Intel macOS systems, but not on Apple M1 systems. Such
binaries are simply disallowed.

*However*, M1 systems have x86_64 emulation capability, in order to be
able to run old macOS binaries.  Thus, an Intel non-PIE executable works
just fine on M1 systems. For that reason, on M1, we actually build an
Intel binary, and everything "just works"! Woo hoo!

This is a true hack. At some point it will probably stop working, but
I'll worry about that when it happens.

On PowerPC Macintosh, things are just weird.

* Using the stock compiler, you can't build gawk (c99 mode) against MPFR;
there is an issue with duplicate inline functions from GMP.  By default,
I have disabled this compilation.

* If you build GCC 4.2.4 and use that version of GCC, you can compile gawk
with MPFR and the C99 settings.  But then the two readfile tests fail.
The call to read(2) simply returns zero. I have no idea why.

Since nobody but me has one of these left, I'm not going to mess
with it anymore right now.

You may need to explicitly tell configure where to find the GNU gettext
header file and library with --with-libintl-prefix=...'. Otherwise,
the nlstringtest test will fail.

I have reports of success on this compiler:

$ gcc --version
Configured with: --prefix=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr 
--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/include/c++/4.2.1
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.1.0
Thread model: posix

============================

There are reports of compilation issues on Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite).
The only compiler reported to have produced a complete pass of
"make check" is the MacPorts compiler, /opt/local/bin/clang-mp-3.5.

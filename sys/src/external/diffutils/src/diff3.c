/* Combine the two diffs together into one.
   Here is the algorithm:

     File2 is shared in common between the two diffs.
     Diff02 is the diff between 0 and 2.
     Diff12 is the diff between 1 and 2.

        1) Find the range for the first block in File2.
            a) Take the lowest of the two ranges (in File2) in the two
               current blocks (one from each diff) as being the low
               water mark.  Assign the upper end of this block as
               being the high water mark and move the current block up
               one.  Mark the block just moved over as to be used.
            b) Check the next block in the diff that the high water
               mark is *not* from.

               *If* the high water mark is above
               the low end of the range in that block,

                   mark that block as to be used and move the current
                   block up.  Set the high water mark to the max of
                   the high end of this block and the current.  Repeat b.

         2) Find the corresponding ranges in File0 (from the blocks
            in diff02; line per line outside of diffs) and in File1.
            Create a diff3_block, reserving space as indicated by the ranges.

         3) Copy all of the pointers for file2 in.  At least for now,
            do memcmp's between corresponding strings in the two diffs.

         4) Copy all of the pointers for file0 and 1 in.  Get what is
            needed from file2 (when there isn't a diff block, it's
            identical to file2 within the range between diff blocks).

         5) If the diff blocks used came from only one of the two
            strings of diffs, then that file (i.e. the one other than
            the common file in that diff) is the odd person out.  If
            diff blocks are used from both sets, check to see if files
            0 and 1 match:

                Same number of lines?  If so, do a set of memcmp's (if
            a memcmp matches; copy the pointer over; it'll be easier
            later during comparisons).  If they match, 0 & 1 are the
            same.  If not, all three different.

     Then do it again, until the blocks are exhausted.  */

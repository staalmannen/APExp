Free BASIC to C converter for Unix-based systems.
BaCon is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems, which runs on
most Unix/Linux/BSD platforms, including MacOSX. It intends to be a programming
aid in creating tools which can be compiled on different platforms (32bit and
64bit environments), while trying to revive the days of the good old BASIC.
Code converted by BaCon can be compiled by GCC, the Compaq C Compiler, TCC,
the clang/LLVM compiler (and possibly by other C compilers), but also by C++
compilers like g++ or clang++.

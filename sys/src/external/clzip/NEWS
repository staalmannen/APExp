Changes in version 1.14:

The option '--empty-error', which forces exit status 2 if any empty member
is found, has been added.

The option '--marking-error', which forces exit status 2 if the first LZMA
byte is non-zero in any member, has been added.

File diagnostics have been reformatted as 'PROGRAM: FILE: MESSAGE'.

Diagnostics caused by invalid arguments to command-line options now show the
argument and the name of the option.

The option '-o, --output' now preserves dates, permissions, and ownership of
the file when (de)compressing exactly one file.

The option '-o, --output' now creates missing intermediate directories when
writing to a file.

The variable MAKEINFO has been added to configure and Makefile.in.

It has been documented in INSTALL that when choosing a C standard, the POSIX
features need to be enabled explicitly:
  ./configure CFLAGS+='--std=c99 -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500'

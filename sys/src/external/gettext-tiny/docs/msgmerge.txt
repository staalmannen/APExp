Usage: msgmerge [OPTION] def.po ref.pot

Merges two Uniforum style .po files together.  The def.po file is an
existing PO file with translations which will be taken over to the newly
created file as long as they still match; comments will be preserved,
but extracted comments and file positions will be discarded.  The ref.pot
file is the last created PO file with up-to-date source references but
old translations, or a PO Template file (generally created by xgettext);
any translations or comments in the file will be discarded, however dot
comments and file positions will be preserved.  Where an exact match
cannot be found, fuzzy matching is used to produce better results.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Input file location:
  def.po                      translations referring to old sources
  ref.pot                     references to new sources
  -D, --directory=DIRECTORY   add DIRECTORY to list for input files search
  -C, --compendium=FILE       additional library of message translations,
                              may be specified more than once

Operation mode:
  -U, --update                update def.po,
                              do nothing if def.po already up to date

Output file location:
  -o, --output-file=FILE      write output to specified file
The results are written to standard output if no output file is specified
or if it is -.

Output file location in update mode:
The result is written back to def.po.
      --backup=CONTROL        make a backup of def.po
      --suffix=SUFFIX         override the usual backup suffix
The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through
the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:
  none, off       never make backups (even if --backup is given)
  numbered, t     make numbered backups
  existing, nil   numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise
  simple, never   always make simple backups
The backup suffix is `~', unless set with --suffix or the SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX
environment variable.

Operation modifiers:
  -m, --multi-domain          apply ref.pot to each of the domains in def.po
  -N, --no-fuzzy-matching     do not use fuzzy matching
      --previous              keep previous msgids of translated messages

Input file syntax:
  -P, --properties-input      input files are in Java .properties syntax
      --stringtable-input     input files are in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings
                              syntax

                              the output page width, into several lines
  -s, --sort-output           generate sorted output
  -F, --sort-by-file          sort output by file location

Informative output:

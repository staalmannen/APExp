OpenVMS porting notes contributed by Pierre.Bru@spotimage.fr

DCL Driver
----------

	The DCL driver is called objc.com, located in src/objc

YACC & LEX
----------

	This port uses the FLEX and BISON ports of those utilities, for VMS.
	(Only needed to recompile the compiler with itself).

Makefiles
---------

	They are specific for OpenVMS, in each directory : Makefile.vms

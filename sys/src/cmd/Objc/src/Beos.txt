  Description: The Portable Objective C compiler by David Stes
        Notes: This is an executable version of the Portable Objective
               C compiler, version 1.8.7, and the source code.  It uses
               mwcc and mwld to do the actual compiling after processing
               the Objective C source into C.  It was compiled to run
               from the GeekGadgets directory, /boot/apps/GeekGadgets.
               After unzipping the package, the files in bin should be
               moved to /boot/apps/GeekGadgets/bin; move the files in
               lib to /boot/apps/GeekGadgets/lib; move the files in
               include to /boot/apps/GeekGadgets/include; and move
               the files in man to /boot/apps/GeekGadgets/man.  You
               should also have /boot/apps/GeekGadgets/bin in your
               execution path in order for the compiler to run.  The
               source for this compiler and its libraries in in the
               src directory.  You can build the compiler and libraries
               by typing the following commands:

                   ./configure powerpc-be-beos (or i586-be-beos)
                   make
                   make cakit
                   make install

               If you want the compiler to install in a different directory,
               such as /boot/usr/local, you can specify it on the configure
               command as follows:

                   ./configure --prefix=/boot/usr/local

               You then do the makes and the compiler will install in
               /boot/usr/local.  Make sure that /boot/usr/local/bin is
               in your PATH environment variable.

WORDS README
------------

"words" is a small program for testing ObjectPak.

When not given a command-line option, it simply reads words (strings
consisting of letters only) from "stdin" and prints nothing to "stdout".

(words -cltn < erasmus)
	Prints all the words in the file "erasmus", in the same order as
	they are encountered

(words -set < erasmus)
	Prints an unordered list of the words in the file, suppressing
	duplicate entries

(words -dic < erasmus)
	 Prints a list of the words in the file and, for each word, its
	 frecuency, i.e., the number of times the word is encountered.

(words -sort < erasmus)
	 Prints a sorted list of the words in the file (sorted with respect
	 to dictionary ordering)

INSTALLATION
------------

Configuration of "ObjectPak" should have created a Makefile for "words".
Type "make" to compile "words"

EXPERIMENTS
------------

(cat erasmus | words -cltn | wc -l)
(cat erasmus | words -cltn | sort -u | wc -l)
(cat erasmus | words -set | wc -l)
(cat erasmus | words -dic | sort -u +1)

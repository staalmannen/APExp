Having Bash as a shell would certainly help APExp in its task of building foreign software.
The final binary is about 10X bigger than the APE pdksh sh, but crashes when executed.

I have been experimenting with disabling job control (nojobs instead of jobs) with no success. 
This was otherwise a thing for mksh.

I tried using acid on the bindary but I am not sure how to move forward with the informaiton gleanded from that.


So if you have the 1337 haxxer skillz needed to get bash working, I would be totally grateful :)

This is an attempt to make the utilities specified in
POSIX 1002.3 available, assuming /$objtype/ape/bin
and /rc/bin/ape are bound to /bin before the regular
bin directories.

General Bugs:

The use of -- as an argument to stop option processing
is generally not done.

The many 'not implemented' functions will be implemented
as scripts using them show up.

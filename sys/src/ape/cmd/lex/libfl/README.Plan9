These two source files should actually be used to build two libraries:

libfl.a and libfl_pic.a

The major difference between the two is that the second is compiled with -fPIC option. As far as I know, pcc does not accept this option anyway...

Need to read up on it though.
At the moment only libfl.a is built and if libfl_pic.a is needed the closest would probably be to copy and rename libfl.a.

mkmk -s libfl -a > mkfile

mkfile edited so that libfl.a is made

the following files were manually edited:

config.h:
* ENABLE_NLS set to 0
* redefined HAVE INTTYPES_H to 1 and undefined HAVE_LIBINTL_H
* absolute path (/bin/gnu/m4) defined for GNU m4
 - this means that GNU m4 will be a makedepend, so m4 should also be packaged as an individual program.

mkmk -o flex -a -S -B -I. -I/sys/include/ape -I/$objtype/include/ape -D_POSIX_SOURCE -D_SUSV2_SOURCE -D_BSD_EXTENSION -DHAVE_CONFIG_H > mkfile
